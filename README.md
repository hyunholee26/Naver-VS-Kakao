# Naver-VS-Kakao
This is for data analysis and visualization competition in [dacon](https://dacon.io/). Dacon is a kind of company carrying out data competition in South Korea like Kaggle. When I want to concentrate on something, I usually make some notes, especially data analysis and visualization. It is one of my favorite hobbies. These days I have under the pressure for graduate school admission, so I needed something to focus on it for several hours.
