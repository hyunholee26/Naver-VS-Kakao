# Naver-VS-Kakao
This is for data analysis and visualization competition in [dacon](https://dacon.io/). Dacon is a kind of company carrying out data competition in South Korea like Kaggle. Composing data analysis and visualization notebooks is one of my favorite hobbies.

Since the competition is carried out in Korea, the comments on the notebooks were written in Korean. [submited link](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235866/codeshare/4187?page=1&dtype=random)
